00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.790
Hi, I quite often have devices like this that&nbsp;
use a standard USB connector however, I quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.350
often have to either measure the power consumed&nbsp;
by this device or measure its performance with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.890
a variety of input voltages or just power it&nbsp;
with a clean lab supply like this, however as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.760
know it may have noticed a normal USB connector&nbsp;
doesn't exactly fit in one of these so I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
designed this little thing here which is&nbsp;
quite simple as just a vertical USB connector a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.790
PCB and some banana jacks and you just plug it in&nbsp;
like this, it's at the standard one inch spacing

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.360
and away you go

00:00:49.360 --> 00:01:03.520
Now the PCB files for this will be in the&nbsp;
description so you can order them from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:12.310
service like PCBWay I ordered 10 but they gave&nbsp;
me a lot more, you can get the banana jacks I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.950
got them from eBay I'm sure you can get them&nbsp;
from element14 or Digi-Key or whatever as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.900
as the vertical USB connectors and that is the&nbsp;
part number if you're interested from Digi-Key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:40.240
now this device is pretty simple it's not many&nbsp;
parts at all however in this video I will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.870
you how to make it just in case. Now a set&nbsp;
of helping hands is extremely recommended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.570
otherwise you're just going to burn your hands&nbsp;
something else that's also recommended is some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.910
leaded solder because these are some rather&nbsp;
large joints so the lower the melting point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:08.530
of the solder the better now I would recommend&nbsp;
the soldering the banana jacks before the USB&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.740
port because the USB port has plastic in it&nbsp;
and you really don't want to melt that now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:25.300
before then you make the soldered joint you&nbsp;
really want to make sure that the banana jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.260
is as flush to the PCB as you can get it&nbsp;
and you want your helping hands to hold it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.890
Now if you have a hot air gun it's a good idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.510
just to warm up the joint so that&nbsp;
it makes soldering a lot easier.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.720
You don't have to get it as hot as if you were say&nbsp;
reflowing surface-mount stuff you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.440
have to get it reasonably warm. Now I'll make&nbsp;
sure your soul during tip is nice and clean

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.330
and make a good connection between&nbsp;
both the PCB and the banana jack

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:48.390
now this is the type of solder joint you're&nbsp;
looking for, one that has a nice smooth fillet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.440
just like that however you want to get it&nbsp;
nice and straight which this certainly isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:05.580
so you can come in with a wet tissue&nbsp;
just so that you don't burn yourself

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.010
Little more solder might help

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.880
and just push it to make sure it's nice and level

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:19.880
and that looks pretty good and don't&nbsp;
forget just to put a little bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.302
solder on your tip just to save it&nbsp;

00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:37.220
so that's what you're looking for

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.240
now you want to make sure to get them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.660
right way round and make the&nbsp;
mistake I did the first time

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.600
bring you in a bit closer this time

00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:24.114
and just make sure this one's nice and level

00:09:53.068 --> 00:10:03.510
now just make sure that they're parallel and&nbsp;
that they're also inline, yeah could be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.580
bit better but that's probably good enough&nbsp;
they will flex ever so slightly when you put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:17.550
them into the plugs now for the USB connector&nbsp;
there's a simple case of clicking it in make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.410
sure it's the right way around there I know&nbsp;
they're a good click and that will hold in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.960
pretty well you want to make sure it's nice&nbsp;
and straight and then you can solder it in

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.940
I can assure you this is much easier&nbsp;
when you've got a camera in the way

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.940
now you don't have to solder the center pins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.820
but it's just a good idea to&nbsp;
hold the part in a bit better

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:53.770
that looks okay and now it's just a case of&nbsp;
letting it cool down because it's pretty hot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.770 --> 00:13:00.610
right now now once it's all cooled down and you've&nbsp;
washed the leaded solder off your hand it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.190
a matter of checking to make sure everything's&nbsp;
done properly that it looks good this is on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:18.460
right side these are on the right side and&nbsp;
they look nice and straight so now it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:26.620
a case of plugging it in and seeing if it works&nbsp;
and remember a positive to positive might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:33.280
bit hard to plug it in the first time there&nbsp;
because the the springs won't be compressed

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:59.060
yep looks a treat again the GitHub page&nbsp;
with the project files in Ki-CAD are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:06.380
in the description as well as some&nbsp;
other stuff and thanks for watching
