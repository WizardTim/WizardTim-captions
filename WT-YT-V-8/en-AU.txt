Failed Slide Potentiometer

Short video about how a piano’s volume slide potentiometer failed due to dust accelerated wear and its subsequent repair. This repair happened quite a while ago, so I never thought to film it properly, the only reason I have those pictures and video are because I was using my camera’s macro lens as a makeshift magnifying glass.
