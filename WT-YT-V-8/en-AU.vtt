00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.443
So quick video, a while ago I was asked to repair one of those Roland ep-75 pianos. 

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:15.973
The volume slide potentiometer was rather scratchy and when you got to about half volume one of the audio channels completely cutout.

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:21.598
So unfortunately I didn't take a picture of the slide poteniometer but this is a picture of one from the internet.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:31.430
It's exactly the same however the one that I had was a bit more rusty and a lot more filthy so I took it apart, took the sliding element out and here's a picture of it.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.279
And as you can see it's quite filthy. So you can really see that the carbon [tracks] that it slides along have come off and clumped together on the slide contacts 

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:46.738
and it's moulded together with probably carpet fibres and t-shirt fibres and a couple of dead bugs.

00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:54.328
So this piano is somewhere between 10 and 20 years old so yeah it's accumulated quite a lot of trash in it.

00:00:54.328 --> 00:01:04.227
So I just cleaned it off with a set of tweezers and a tissue soaked in Isopropanol Alcohol and that cleaned it up pretty good, it's nice and shiny now.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:13.880
And I also bent the contacts back out to give them a bit more spring and a bit more pressure on the tracks, and that did solve the scratchy noise problem when you were sliding it.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.083
However one of the channels was still completely cutout.

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:26.867
I had a look at the carbon tracks and one of them was completely worn away the other one was about to go and that was just from adjusting the volume in that position so much.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:34.396
So as repairing that slide switch was not going to happen I just went to the internet and bought a new one, unfortunately that one had been discontinued, 

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:44.904
but I found this one that had the same footprint but it also had a nice dust cover but where you put the cap on was unfortunately a different size but that was solved by just gluing the cap on to it.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:53.390
And this here is a picture of it affixed in the piano and that solved it and hopefully that dust cover will keep out any dust in the future.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:07.988
And doing this really made me realise why a lot of industrial products especially mixing desks and other things with slide potentiometers often have the track not mounted upwards but either 90 degrees or in some cases completely inverted.

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:14.995
Those things aren't going to let anywhere near as much rubbish in them which will hopefully increase the longevity of the slide [potentiometer].

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:19.005
So hopefully you found this interesting, and thanks for watching.
