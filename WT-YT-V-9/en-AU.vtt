00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.560
This here is an AudioMoth from Open Acoustic&nbsp;
Devices, these devices are typically used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.080
ecoacoustic applications as they can record&nbsp;
ultrasound frequencies however they're useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.560
in pretty much any application that involves&nbsp;
recording over a large period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.200
This particular unit is an AudioMoth 1.0 which has a&nbsp;
bit of a problem in which the switch overhangs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.800
PCB which makes it very accessible and easy to use&nbsp;
however it leaves the switch rather vulnerable to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.680
breaking off like we see here on this one. And&nbsp;
I should also mention that this is sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.880
a problem with the [micro] SD card slot as well if you&nbsp;
have a particularly tight custom enclosure it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.840
can snap the SD card. Now this problem has been&nbsp;
fixed on the AudioMoth 1.1 and the new 1.2 as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.360
you see here the switch is recessed into the PCB&nbsp;
and a number of other improvements have also been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.840
made such as lowering the noise floor and adding&nbsp;
an external microphone jack however the old 1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.560
PCB is still perfectly fine for pretty much all&nbsp;
applications so I'd like to fix this one here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.200
today and show you as well how to do it. There is&nbsp;
actually a post on the [Open Acoustic Devices] forum page&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.360
about another person who's also fixed a broken&nbsp;
switch however their approach involves taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.880
off the battery holder which requires you to&nbsp;
desolder it and well I don't particularly want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.040
do that and I imagine a lot of other people don't&nbsp;
particularly want to have to desolder it as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.000
so I'm going to show you here how to do it without&nbsp;
desoldering anything this here is the switch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.868
that's used on the AudioMoth it's a Nidec Copal 
series CSS1310, you can get this from pretty much any

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:46.473
electronics component supplier such as Digi-Key&nbsp;
or Farnell or element14 or Mouser 

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.453
and in some cases you can even find it on eBay.

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:56.240
So i'll leave&nbsp;some links in the description below if you want to get them just keep in mind that wherever you&nbsp;are in the world shipping might be more expensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.561
than the switches themselves so shop around. 
Now&nbsp;if we take a look at the switch we can see that there's three major components to it there's the&nbsp;plastic black body 

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:14.960
as well as the white sliding&nbsp;element along with a metal clip that retains this&nbsp;
we want to unclip this metal retaining bracket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.703
and we can do this by just putting in a metal&nbsp;
spudger underneath the clip and levering it up...

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:30.533
on either sides and then just pulling it out like&nbsp;
this and today we're going to use both the slider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.000
nub as well as the metal retaining bracket&nbsp;
however don't throw out the plastic black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.640
body just in case you need it one day put it&nbsp;
back with the other switches. Now to remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.120
the old switch we have to remove this bracket&nbsp;
however it's very difficult to try and unclip it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.760
so we're going to try and cut it in half. 
So&nbsp;I've just got a pair of old tweezers that I

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.760
don't care about bending and I'm going to shove it&nbsp;
in here and bend up so that we can cut it in half.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.760
And now that I've bent it up sufficiently I
can just cut it with a pair of side cutters

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.160
and with it cut I can get a lot more leverage on&nbsp;
it with the side cutters now so I can pull it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.160
even further and get the other side up where I can&nbsp;
cut it and that also just cut pretty much the same

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.680
and now if it cut it's much much easier to&nbsp;
just remove it and we can remove both parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.560
and remove the sliding element and this is also&nbsp;
a good opportunity to give it a little bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360
a clean as well. Now in order to get the new&nbsp;
metal bracket on you'll notice that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.400
two little pins at the bottom these are to give&nbsp;
it some extra strength and hold it in place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.080
however we're not going to be able to put that&nbsp;
on because it's already mounted to the PCB and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.720
the battery holder is in the way so we're just&nbsp;
going to cut it off with a pair of side cutters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.200
now this thing is, I'm pretty sure it's made of&nbsp;
steel so it is actually rather difficult to cut so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.320
you probably don't want to use your good pair of&nbsp;
side cutters and make sure when you do cut them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.440
cover them with your fingers so that the pieces of&nbsp;
metal don't go flying into your eye or somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.960
around the room. Now with all that done it's just&nbsp;
a matter of putting the switch back together so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.840
you can just drop the new sliding element back in&nbsp;
and then you can put the metal bracket back on top...

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.840
...and push down on it and you'll hear two&nbsp;
distinctive clicks to know it's locked in place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.440
and that's pretty much it should be good to&nbsp;
go we can see the switch works perfectly now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.840
So as always thanks for watching
