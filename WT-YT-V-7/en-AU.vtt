00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.640
So in my last video we had a look at phenolic PCBs&nbsp;
and how bad they are at resisting moisture and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.160
high temperatures when reflowing, if you haven't&nbsp;
seen that video I'll leave it in a card here.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.280
But what about FR-4 PCBs that we're probably&nbsp;
more familiar with if you've ordered them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.400
from the various online manufacturers you&nbsp;
might have received them packed in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.400
sealed packaging with a silica gel so this would&nbsp;
lead you to believe that these are actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.720
quite moisture sensitive, but in that video I did&nbsp;
say that FR-4 PCBs are pretty much better in every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:46.867
single way both in temperature resistance and&nbsp;
moisture sensitivity so I thought I'd make this&nbsp;video and put that to the test. 

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:52.080
So here I have a&nbsp;
FR-4 PCB from a online PCB manufacturer and we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.400
going to be putting it to the test at 300 °C&nbsp;
and see how it holds up against the phenolic PCB.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.880
So having a look at the aftermath&nbsp;
it's pretty difficult to see but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.160
there is some slight discoloration, you&nbsp;
can see some of the pads are oxidized.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000
To make it easier to see I've&nbsp;
upped the contrast in this frame&nbsp;,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.400
so you can really see the dark area is the&nbsp;
area that's been discolored by the high&nbsp;temperature,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.000
but it's it's only very minor in&nbsp;
comparison to the phenolic PCB. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.560
So seeing as 300 °C didn't do it let's try 500 °C and&nbsp;
that's the highest my little heat gun can go.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.360
And as we see it pretty&nbsp;
quickly starts to degrade

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.080
and discolor, I'm not quite sure&nbsp;
what this would be referred to as.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.520
So jabbing tweezers into it we can see it's&nbsp;
pretty much lost all it's structural integrity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.160
we can see a lot of the fibers in the fiberglass&nbsp;
are just pulling apart and these tracks aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.840
held on anymore at all so pretty much if you're&nbsp;
if your PCB gets to 500 °C you're screwed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.120
but at that point you've got bigger problems. So&nbsp;
looking at it we can actually see the actual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.560
fiberglass weave under all of this burnt epoxy&nbsp;
and here we have the individual fiberglass strands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.440
interestingly the epoxy is completely gone you&nbsp;
can see the individual strands there's no epoxy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.138
holding it together anymore it's all burnt away.

00:02:37.138 --> 00:02:41.665
So&nbsp;we had a look at both 300 °C and 500 °C&nbsp;

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:48.800
and in both cases there wasn't any damage due&nbsp;
to moisture like we saw on the phenolic PCB&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.840
so here I have soaked this FR-4 PCB in water so we&nbsp;
should be able to get some pretty good action here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.960
now looking at the side of the PCB you can&nbsp;
see just how far the water has wicked up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.240
now this PCB has been in here for about&nbsp;
a week so it's pretty much soaked full of water.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.880
So here I've got it set to&nbsp;
350 °C just so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.840
we can definitely see some action&nbsp;
from this PCB and if we look at it.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.240
It's all going nice and then suddenly it oh yeah&nbsp;
it just completely delaminates and forms this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.905
massive bubble and we can see that the epoxy&nbsp;
is starting to burn as well because we're at&nbsp;such a high temperature. 

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:47.680
Now trying it again&nbsp;
on the other side but this time with a normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.080
temperature of 260 °C we can see&nbsp;
that it's resisting it a fair bit more

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.560
but here we have exactly the same problem of&nbsp;
the layers delaminating and it forming a nice...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.520
well a terrible bubble in this case we&nbsp;
definitely never want to see this but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.080
this is exactly what I want to see because it&nbsp;
proves the point that they are moisture sensitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.560
but nowhere near as bad as phenolic PCBs and if&nbsp;
I take my tweezers just to show you that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.840
this bubble is certainly pressurized with&nbsp;
some sort of gas presumably water vapor.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.720
So I've let it cool down now and you can see the&nbsp;
outline of where that bubble was and the where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.216
layers have delaminated so yeah all this
area here is where it stopped interestingly the&nbsp;vias,

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:50.960
interestingly here the vias appear&nbsp;
to have actually stopped the delamination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.552
which is rather interesting it might be a good&nbsp;
little trick to use vias to hold the layers&nbsp;together better 

00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:07.601
I know that you can often use&nbsp;
vias to ensure pads adhere better to the PCB so&nbsp;they don't fall off.

00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:11.840
So I'm very interested to&nbsp;
see just what's underneath this bubble so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.800
we're going to do a destructive teardown and&nbsp;
have a look at the individual layers so I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.320
just going to cut it here with this X-ACTO knife,&nbsp;
be careful with an X-ACTO knife if you do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.200
and now that we've cut the top copper layer&nbsp;
we can just pry it up just like that and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.840
can see that we've just took the top copper&nbsp;
layer off it's delaminated from the fiberglass.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.120
Interestingly we can see the pattern of the&nbsp;
epoxy on the copper so it looks like when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.960
peeled up the copper actually took the epoxy with&nbsp;
it although on the edge it didn't and this layer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.600
of fiberglass is still quite loose so I'm going to&nbsp;
cut away further at this to see if we can expose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.360
the lower layers so cutting it with that X-ACTO&nbsp;
knife again and see here I can actually put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.840
X-ACTO knife in underneath that fiberglass layer&nbsp;
so again this layer here is completely delaminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.960
and yeah I can just pull this up with some&nbsp;
tweezers it's rather rigid but yeah it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.480
done a fair bit of damage to this although&nbsp;
interestingly this tab hasn't delaminated as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.560
much as the other one so I'm not sure if that&nbsp;
top layer delaminating was just a result of me

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.267
so yeah just jamming the tweezers in and&nbsp;
pulling it up works pretty good

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:52.240
Now just to&nbsp;prove to you that this isn't just a result of&nbsp;
cutting a normal FR-4 PCB that if you cut it it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.720
falls apart like this so I'll just cut it over&nbsp;
here where I didn't apply the high temperature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.320
and as you can see if I cut it, it doesn't&nbsp;
fall apart at all it's held together quite well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.240
yeah I try to get the knife in here but it's just,&nbsp;
it's not going to come up there's no delamination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.641
it's all held together quite well without epoxy.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:23.920
So taking a closer look at the macro lens we can&nbsp;really see that the copper has pulled up the epoxy&nbsp;with it, so I'm not sure if this was part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:33.520
delamination from the gases because the other&nbsp;
flaps appeared to still be adhered quite well but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.800
in the case of all four flaps the first fiberglass&nbsp;
layer is definitely completely delaminated from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.840
the second fiberglass layer, here you can see&nbsp;
the difference between where the epoxy has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.800
been pulled up by the copper and where it stops&nbsp;
and the epoxy is still adhered to the fiberglass.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.880
So I've now pulled back the top copper as well&nbsp;
as the first fiberglass layer a lot more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.600
we can see actually that the second fiberglass&nbsp;
layer does actually have an air bubble behind it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.840
we can see here the extremity of the bubble&nbsp;
here and we can see that this area here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.440
is still adhered together and hasn't delaminated&nbsp;
so i suspect that these lower layers were probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.720
delaminated by the high temperature on the&nbsp;
other side. In hindsight i probably should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.720
have just gotten another PCB and done a second&nbsp;
test with that without doing it on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.152
but I couldn't be bothered to put another one&nbsp;
of these in a glass of water for a week and let&nbsp;it do its thing.

00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:45.680
So here we can really see that&nbsp;
this first layer is completely delaminated and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.080
you can really see that there's quite a definite&nbsp;
position of where it's delaminated and you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.320
see that this top layer is actually a smaller&nbsp;
area than the second layer's delamination so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.280
yeah I'm pretty sure that second layer is because&nbsp;
of the damage from the first test and we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.480
here that the surface is very smooth for&nbsp;
where the copper has been pulled off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:19.120
epoxy that covers the fiberglass and here's just a&nbsp;
close-up image of that and here's another close-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.200
you can see here to the left the epoxy still has&nbsp;
the texture from the other layer of fiberglass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.400
in it and this bit here still has the top copper&nbsp;
and the first layer of fiberglass but where I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.040
ripped it you can see that every second strand 
is sticking out which is rather interesting way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.745
how it tore and here's another close-up of&nbsp;
where I've ripped off the top fiberglass layer.

00:09:50.233 --> 00:09:54.880
These are pieces of fiberglass unlike&nbsp;
the first high temperature test where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.160
epoxy was actually burnt and was degraded&nbsp;
these still have the epoxy in them so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:07.040
if I poke and prod them with an implement you&nbsp;
can see that they're still completely rigid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.336
unlike before where you could see the individual&nbsp;
fibers that just splayed apart.

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:24.816
So that's it&nbsp;for this video so I hope you've learned&nbsp;
something and as always thanks for watching
