00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.560
So I'm in the need of some TO-3 transistors&nbsp;
like this one here although this one here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.400
a genuine HP spare from Motorola, it's some&nbsp;
sort of BJT transistor this one's from 1988&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.080
so I don't particularly want to use this one but&nbsp;
this is what a TO-3 transistor looks like if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.520
haven't seen one before it's a three pin device&nbsp;
although one of the pins is actually the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.880
but I need a few TO-3 transistors&nbsp;
for a project it's just a constant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.960
current dummy load so I don't really want&nbsp;
to spend very much on the transistors for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.480
it but I’d like to use TO-3 transistors&nbsp;
as something cool and unusual as using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.680
TO-220 transistors does get a bit boring after&nbsp;
a while although TO-220 is quite a nice package&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:58.080
so I’ve heard that the 2N3055 is a rather common&nbsp;
TO-3 transistor so searching it up on Digi-Key we find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:09.760
a few results here we have one, oh, unit price&nbsp;
call and unit price AU$65 no thank you although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:22.400
they do have some more and uh AU$107 no thanks
other than there so in stock and also exclude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.320
marketplace items because I do not trust this 
Rochester Electronics I swear they mislead people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.600
on how many they have in stock I’ve seen them&nbsp;
with millions in stock which is not feasible but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.520
searching for that we've got two left&nbsp;
one for AU$107 which no chance and the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.720
from ON-Semi for AU$9.73 and they&nbsp;
actually have stock although that's still way too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.360
much if I was doing an actual proper project this&nbsp;
is what I would buy but as just something for fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.880
um yeah no thank you so of course when you can't&nbsp;
find something for a reasonable price on Digi-Key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.400
of course down to eBay and here we have an eBay&nbsp;
listing for those same transistors and we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.560
10 for the low low price of AU$4.84 although&nbsp;
plus AU$2.64 shipping which is much better than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.840
nine dollars and something for just one but how&nbsp;
reputable are these especially when buying from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.760
eBay which doesn't really support per listing&nbsp;
feedback unlike AliExpress where you tend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.720
get a lot more feedback per listing and per&nbsp;
seller so these look pretty suspicious although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.120
I think it will be rather interesting to see&nbsp;
what actually shows up so I’ve bought them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.360
and this is what showed up here and oh&nbsp;
boy yeah these look very very uh genuine

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.840
let's have a closer look at one of them

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.640
yeah so this marking looks a bit&nbsp;
suspicious although it does say ST 2N3055&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.720
and a whole bunch of other manufacturing&nbsp;
codes which seem to be the same on all of them

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.400
although interestingly comparing it to&nbsp;
the genuine HP part we can see that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.560
thickness of the metal and the size and&nbsp;
shape of the can is actually correct so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.280
maybe there is a chance for this&nbsp;
one although if you've been paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.840
especially close attention you may have noticed&nbsp;
there's something a little bit off about the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.400
it almost looks like someone has painted over the&nbsp;
previous marking and put a new one on yeah that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.560
very confidence inspiring now in this case it's&nbsp;
pretty obvious the paint doesn't match very well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.480
although here's a trick many people when making&nbsp;
paints they only really anticipate that people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.520
going to look at them under normal light so they&nbsp;
don't really think about matching the paint for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.400
UV light so looking at this under UV light we can&nbsp;
see yes there's a massive difference between where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.600
it's been painted yeah and this one's actually&nbsp;
rather good they uh managed to get it on only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.360
the top although here's one where they were a bit&nbsp;
too generous with the paint and it's uh leaked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.800
down the side so let's see maybe there's&nbsp;
something underneath this paint not quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.480
sure why they'd paint over it and not just rub the&nbsp;
previous marking off so maybe it's laser engraved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.840
so spraying it with some isopropanol alcohol and&nbsp;
wiping it we can see it comes off pretty easy

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.440
so then I just submerged&nbsp;
it in some more isopropanol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.080
and then gave it a bit of a rub&nbsp;
more and the paint quickly came off

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.720
although unfortunately we can see underneath it&nbsp;
isn't laser engraved it presumably was just ink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.080
stamped so I’m not quite sure why they'd bother to&nbsp;
paint over the entire thing instead of just taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.960
it off with solvent but sure whatever it must be&nbsp;
cheaper somehow I don't really understand how low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.880
paint's somewhat expensive especially metallic-ish&nbsp;
paint although one thing I quickly realized was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
that you don't actually have to submerge this&nbsp;
in alcohol to remove the paint the paint can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.120
just be scraped off with a plastic tool like this&nbsp;
ruler here so I’m rather interested to see what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.800
actually inside this so I took a pair of side&nbsp;
cutters to it and just started cutting it open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.600
I could have used the Dremel but I didn't really&nbsp;
want to get filings of metal all over this thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.480
because I think it might be interesting to have&nbsp;
a look at it working without the case on and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.200
that we've got a little hole we can see that yes&nbsp;
there is actually a die in here and it's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.920
bigger than I was expecting I was expecting some&nbsp;
tiny little two by two millimetre die that's out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.840
of say a 2N222 transistor that they've stuck in&nbsp;
here but no it is actually a reasonably large die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.400
so this may actually be a genuine part.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.320
So cutting it into it more just&nbsp;
to take the entire lid off.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.200
And if you do go doing this please be careful&nbsp;
because the metal ends up being quite sharp.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.800
and now that we've got it all off we can see that&nbsp;
the die is actually mounted on this little piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.040
of metal here which presumably increases the&nbsp;
junction-to-case thermal coefficient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.960
so they definitely haven't cheaped out on that&nbsp;
aspect so I’m wondering if this is actually a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.320
genuine part that's actually a different&nbsp;
transistor that they've just relabelled 2N3055&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.480
because that's a very commonly searched transistor&nbsp;
and people will maybe pay more for that so I’m not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.680
quite sure what's really going on here because&nbsp;
this transistor looks like it would do the job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.240
there's nothing really wrong with the size of&nbsp;
the die or the construction of the metal case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.240
the wire bonding is a bit dodgy but I mean that's&nbsp;
sort of to be expected in these sort of low cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.880
electronics but I mean it would still work the&nbsp;
wire bond here that's broken though that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.200
was because of me so yes rather interesting to see&nbsp;
what's inside one of these cheap eBay transistors

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.600
So I hope you at least learnt something&nbsp;
maybe out of this I’ll just leave you with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.760
this thermal image though that I thought was&nbsp;
pretty cool of it operating without the case on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.840
and as always thanks for watching
