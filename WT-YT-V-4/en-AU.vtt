00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.640
This is the ubiquitous TO-220
through-hole package that I'm sure we're all familiar with.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.300
This device in particular is the popular 1117 low-drop-out voltage regulator

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.440
manufactured by ST. And the first thing you're probably

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600
going to calculate when using one of
these

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.960
is the thermal performance and so the
data sheet here gives us these figures

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.800
for the package thermal resistances. With
this here junction to ambient figure we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.239
can calculate the die temperature for a
given amount of power

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.360
or conversely the power at which the
regulator reaches Tj max.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.280
So as you can see calculating the
thermal performance of this package when

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320
free standing
is very easy and the numbers you get are

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.960
quite often very close to reality.
But of course the big advantage of using

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.520
a TO-220 style device is the fact that
it can be bolted to an external heatsink

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
which allows it to dissipate
significantly more than 2 watts

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.280
or simply just operate at a lower
temperature and extend its life.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.960
So this here is a pretty standard
stamped copper heatsink from AAVID Thermology

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.320
and looking at the data sheet for this

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.520
we find
a nice little graph here which is quite

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119
common amongst heatsinks
although i wish manufacturers would use

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.840
meters per second
not US customary feet per minute.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
But using this line here we can find how
hot our heatsink will get for a given

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.840
amount of power dissipated with
convection cooling only

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.079
or if we have forced airflow we can use
this other line to get a thermal

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.320
resistance to ambient figure.
Doing the calculations again but instead

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.680
for this configuration
we can easily show that this will reduce

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.520
the die temperature
at 2 watts to significantly less than Tj max.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.720
So doing this kind of thermal design

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.640
calculations with this TO-220
through-hole part is pretty easy and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.079
straightforward.
Instead you should be worrying about

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.479
making sure you have the correct
mounting force

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.119
or whether or not you're placing it next
to a wet electrolytic capacitor.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.280
But what about this same 1117
regulator but instead from

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.640
Advanced Monolithic Systems and in this 
SOT-223 package

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.040
how do we do the same calculations. Well
looking at the datasheet again we see

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.400
thermal resistance numbers
but with this asterisk; thermal

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.319
resistance depends on the size of copper
area connected to the case tab.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.560
Okay that makes sense seeing as the
tab is soldered to the PCB

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680
and it's not like there's a bolt hole
you can connect the heatsink to.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.840
And so if we look further we see that
they've given us a nice little table of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.440
thermal resistances
for several different sizes of copper

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.640
areas and well this looks easy enough to
calculate

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.000
and it actually is. However, the problem
comes when you actually come to apply

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.080
this
let's look here at this PCB and well

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.519
what here counts towards our copper area
what

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.560
parts will actually provide useful heat
sinking

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.319
I mean all this copper here in the
ground plate probably counts right?

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.000
There's only these little tiny gaps
between the copper areas here between

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.680
the power rail and the ground plane
and well I see regulators on PCBs like

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.959
this all the time
that just use the minimum footprint size

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.360
with the ground plane surrounding it
I mean the thermal resistance of the pcb

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.520
can't be that bad right?
I mean look here we've got copper at 400

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.060
watts per meter kelvin and
going down, oh, ohhhhhh...

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.400
okay yeah this might be a problem.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.640
So
this here is a PCB I designed back in

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280
2016
I made it for fun to see if I could make

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
my own multiplexed LED matrix
and I'm pretty proud of it I was even

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.959
able to get the entire LED matrix on
one layer because I used the LED leads

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.159
themselves as jumpers across the common anode lines

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.560
useful little trick for you however
today we're interested in it because on

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.040
the back of it we have the same
AMS1117 regulator with a nice

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.200
little PCB heatsink.
Now at full brightness this regulator

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000
dissipates
less than a quarter of a watt so this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.319
heatsink is plenty big enough.
However I have here a spare PCB that

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.680
I've repurposed as a thermal test board
and I've been

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.760
abusing it just a little bit. By the way
if you've ever wondered what happens to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.639
a 1206
quarter watt resistor when you put

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.480
several watts through it
for a little bit too long yeah don't do it.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.880
So we're going to use this
PCB

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.199
to test our theory to see whether or not
these little gaps actually do anything

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.720
currently I have the board under the
thermal camera now

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.720
and I've got the output loaded down so
it will dissipate about one and a

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.720
quarter watts
and when we turn it on we instantly see

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.680
the temperature rise.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.880
Okay now that it's reached steady state
we can clearly see the outline of that

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.479
copper area directly connected to the
package tab

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.720
so unfortunately that means the
temperature drop across this little gap

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.840
here is
rather significant so that's definitely

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.320
going to have an effect on how much heat
is conducted into this ground plane and

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.000
it's probably not as much as I would
have liked.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.759
And of course if we push this
device even further

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.240
to dissipate several watts we can see
this little heatsink is never gonna save it.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.280
And so this brings us to the part where

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.080
I screwed it all up with my thermal
design and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.680
roasted some LEDs. This here
is a modular LED panel I designed back

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.680
in 2018
before I had a thermal camera and before

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.280
I knew
these gaps were a big problem for SMT design.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.600
This thing is pretty simple it
takes 12 volts and steps it down to a

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.160
constant current for the LEDs
with near zero flicker and the

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.720
brightness is controlled with this
potentiometer.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.800
I actually use three of these panels on
a shared heatsink above me

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.000
for filming and reference photography
and at

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.639
10 watts per panel I get about a
1,000 lux here with them all at 50%

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.520
which is more than enough. So overall I'm
happy with them and all of the files are

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.120
on GitHub if you're interested
although you might not want to use them

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.759
after I show you the problem it has.
If we look here at the LED side of the

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.080
traces
we see the pads of the LEDs are

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.160
connected to these big traces
and when designing it I paid extra

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.360
special attention
to length matching these traces to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.479
equally drive the LEDs.
But I just assume these little gaps here

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.039
between the traces in the ground plane
wouldn't be a big contributor to thermal

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.639
problems
I even had plenty of vias to transfer

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.199
heat to the other side of the board
but again here I have the same problem

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.160
with traces and gaps in the ground plane.
I was assuming that this would be enough

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.919
to transfer
heat out of the PCB and into the

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.800
heatsink
and well I was kind of correct it

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.639
doesn't instantly catch fire
but, I definitely could have done a lot

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.599
better and not needed to actively cool
the heatsink

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.340
if I had designed it just a little
different.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.080
So I have the LED side of the PCB

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.120
now under the thermal
camera and

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.160
turning it on yeah we see the gaps are
definitely a problem here as well.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.000
And now at steady state we can see this
thing has

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.560
big problems running at 100%. Now remember
this thermal camera

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.360
can only show us the temperature of the
top of the phosphor of this LED

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.800
and that's at 112 °C that's
not the die temperature

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.680
the die temperature is
definitely over Tj max which is 115 °C

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.199
so this LED is definitely having a short life.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.840
And again we see the heat isn't

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.560
conducted very well across this gap, heat
is still

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.319
transferred but it's nowhere near as
good as it could be

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.840
taking a look at the other side of the
PCB now

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.840
and we can see the vias are doing a
great job at transferring heat through

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.560
the PCB to the other side
however we have the same problem.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.680
And this side we're relying on the copper
area

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.000
to spread out the heat so it can be
transferred through more surface area to

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.680
the heatsink and it's definitely not
doing a good job at that.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.720
So I hope you've learned something
useful here so you don't have to go

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.199
through the same mistakes i did to learn
this.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:27.840
So as always thanks for watching.     :)
