SMT Crystal Oscillator Teardown

Taking a look at the construction and inner workings of a common SMT ceramic LCC package quartz crystal oscillator from KDS / Daishinku Corporation (株式会社大真空) manufactured in the late 1990s.


The quartz strip resonator measures 4.96 x 2.46 x 0.10 mm, this hints at this being a 16 MHz crystal with the oscillator circuit using the third overtone at 48 MHz.


Update: New microscope pictures and datasheet.
