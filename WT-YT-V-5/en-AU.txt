ZFS Disk Failure and Recovery

My journey over the past few weeks dealing with and attempting to recover a ‘failed’ hard drive in my 3-year-old ZFS pool using 4x ST3000DM008 7,200 rpm mechanical drives in raidz1.

Special thanks to Mark Furneaux for his videos about ZFS & pfSense which convinced me 4 years ago to abandon hardware RAID on Windows Server 2012 and go with ZFS on Ubuntu (a decision I'm still very happy with).

The dramatization parody short in this video contains scenes from the 1979 feature film 'The China Syndrome' © Columbia Pictures. 
Those scenes have undergone a significant transformation using computer graphics to convey a parody which has been done in good faith as ‘fair use’ in accordance with section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act 1976.
